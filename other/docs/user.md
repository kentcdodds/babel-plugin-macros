# `babel-plugin-macros` Usage for users

## Adding the plugin to your config

### Via `.babelrc` (Recommended)

**.babelrc**

```json
{
  "plugins": ["macros"]
}
```

### Via [`babel.config.js`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/configuration#babelconfigjs)

**babel.config.js**

```javascript
module.exports = function (api) {
  return {
    plugins: ['macros'],
  }
}
```

### Via CLI

```shell
babel --plugins babel-plugin-macros script.js
```

### Via Node API

```js
require('babel-core').transform('code', {
  plugins: ['macros'],
})
```

## Using a macro

With the `babel-plugin-macros` plugin added to your config, we can now use a
macro that works with the `babel-plugin-macros` API. Let's assume we have such a
module in our project called `eval.macro.js`. To use it, we `import` or
`require` the macro module in our code like so:

```javascript
import MyEval from './eval.macro'
// or
const MyEval = require('./eval.macro')
```

Then we use that variable however the documentation for the macro says.
Incidentally, `eval.macro.js` actually exists in the tests for
`babel-plugin-macros` [here][eval-macro] and you can see how it transforms our
code in [the `babel-plugin-macros` snapshots][eval-snapshots].

> Note here that the real benefit is that we don't need to configure anything
> for every macro you add. We simply configure `babel-plugin-macros`, then we
> can use any macro available. This is part of the benefit of using
> `babel-plugin-macros`.

### Using with create-react-app

> [Checkout the CRA Macro Example repo](https://github.com/kentcdodds/cra-macro-example)

`babel-plugin-macros` ships with `react-scripts` 2.0! This is awesome because it
allows for babel to be configured in a nice way without having to eject from
`create-react-app`!

Before deciding to use this however you should be aware of a few things:

1. Features may be broken or not work as expected
2. Documentation for new features is still sparse, so look through the pull
   requests for how they're expected to work

With that being said you can use all the awesomeness of `babel-plugin-macros`
inside `create-react-app` by running one of the following commands based on your
situation.

```
$ # Create a new application
$ npx create-react-app my-app
$ # Upgrade an existing application
$ yarn upgrade react-scripts
```

### config

There is a feature that allows you to configure your macro. We use
[`lilconfig`][lilconfig] to read a `babel-plugin-macros` configuration which can
be located in any of the following files up the directories from the importing
file:

- `.babel-plugin-macrosrc`
- `.babel-plugin-macrosrc.json`
- `.babel-plugin-macrosrc.yaml`
- `.babel-plugin-macrosrc.yml`
- `.babel-plugin-macrosrc.js`
- `babel-plugin-macros.config.js`
- `babelMacros` in `package.json`

You need to specify your `configName`. EG: For configuring [styled-components
macro][styled-components], the `configName` is `"styledComponents"`:

```js
// babel-plugin-macros.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  // Other macros config
  styledComponents: {
    pure: true,
  },
}
```
